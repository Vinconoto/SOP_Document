## Objective
This SOP provides a step-by-step guide to set up a Windows Server, ensuring a reliable and secure installation and configuration for production or development environments. This SOP ensures a structured and efficient setup for a Windows Server tailored to meet our organizational needs.

## Application
This procedure applies to IT administrators responsible for deploying a Windows Server as a file server, domain controller, application host, or other roles within an organization.

## Prerequisites
### Before starting, ensure the following: 
* **Hardware Requirements:** Confirm server hardware meets Windows Server version requirements.
  *  CPU: 1.4 GHz (64-bit processor)
  *  RAM: 2 GB (minimum)
  * Disk Space: 32 GB (minimum)
* **Installation Media:** Bootable USB/DVD with the appropriate Windows Server ISO.
* **Network Configuration:** Static IP details, domain information (if applicable).
* **Administrator Credentials:** Access to create or manage an admin account.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Install Windows Server
1. **Insert Installation Media:** Boot the server using the USB/DVD.
2. **Boot to Installation Media:** 
    * Restart the server and access the BIOS/UEFI by pressing the designated key (e.g., F2, F12, or Delete).
    * Set the boot priority to the USB/DVD and save changes.
3. **Start Installation:** Follow the on-screen instructions: 
    * Select language, time, and keyboard input.
    * Click **Install Now**.
4. **Enter Product Key:** Provide the license key or choose "I don't have a product key" to activate later.
5. **Choose Installation Type:** 
    * **Server with Desktop Experience:** Includes GUI.
    * **Server Core:** Command-line only (for advanced users).
6. **Partition the Disk:** 
    * Select the drive and format or create new partitions as necessary.
    * Click Next to begin installation.
7. **Complete Installation:** The server will restart several times. Once finished, create an administrator account and set a strong password.

### Step 2: Configure Initial Server Settings
1. **Log In:** Use the administrator credentials created during setup.
2. **Run Server Manager:** This launches automatically after login.
3. **Configure Network Settings:** 
    * Open **Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change Adapter Settings.**
    * Right-click the active network adapter, select **Properties**, and configure: 
          * Static IP
          * Subnet mask
          * Default gateway
          *Preferred DNS server
4. **Rename Server:** 
    * Go to **Server Manager > Local Server > Computer Name.**
    * Click *Change*, provide a meaningful name, and restart.
5. **Install Updates:**
    * Open **Settings > Windows Update > Check for updates** and install all pending updates.

### Step 3: Configure Roles and Features
1. **Launch Add Roles and Features Wizard:** 
    * In **Server Manager**, click **Manage > Add Roles and Features.**
2. **Follow the Wizard:** 
    * Choose **Role-based or feature-based installation**.
    * Select the server from the server pool.
    *Add required roles: 
        * Example: **Active Directory Domain Services** for a domain controller, or **File and Storage Services** for a file server.
3. **Install Selected Roles:** Review and confirm the selection to start the installation. Restart if prompted.

### Step 4: Secure the Server
1. **Enable Windows Firewall:** 
    * Open **Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Turn Windows Defender Firewall On or Off.**
2. **Configure Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware:** Install a security solution as per organizational policy.
3. **Set User Account Control (UAC):**
    * Adjust UAC settings to prevent unauthorized changes to the system.
4. **Create Backups:** 
    * Set up regular backups using **Windows Server Backup** or third-party tools.

### Step 5: Final Testing
1. **Verify Network Connectivity:** Test the serverâ€™s connection to the network and other resources.
2. **Check Installed Roles:** Ensure roles (e.g., AD DS, File Services) are functioning as expected.
3. **Document Configurations:** Record all configuration settings, including IP, hostname, and installed roles.

### Maintenance
* **Regular Updates:** Schedule and install updates to ensure security and performance.
* **Monitor Logs:** Use Event Viewer to track and address issues proactively.
* **Review Security Settings:** Periodically audit firewall, permissions, and account configurations.
